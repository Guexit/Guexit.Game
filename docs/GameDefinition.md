## Proposal 1

TryGuessIt is a multiplayer game that consists of guess what image a person have decided to relate with a concept it has said.
The game is turn-based. Each turn a person must be the responsible of thinking of a concept and writing it down secretly. Then the game will generate a set of AI generated images related with that concept. The set will be public to every player of the game. 

Everyone but the person who decide the concept will have to choose an image that they think other players will think was the choosen by the person to decided the concept. After all have decided their image, they will have a turn for everyone to vote which was the one was the decision of the person who decided the concept. Each other person than the one that decided the concept will have a point per each vote to their image. If you vote properly to the one that the concept decider selected, you get 3 points. 

The person who decided the concept will have 3 points + one per each vote if at least one person didn't vote the one he selected. If all other persons vote the one that selected the concept decider he will get no points.

## Proposal 2 
_Literally dixit but online and all images generated by AI._
